        <h1>Spread of covid-19 in Italy</h1>
        <p>The Italian "Protezione civile" is in charge of offical daily 
            bulletins on COVID-19. The whole dataset has been made available
            in  
            <a href="https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19">https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            I built a simple animation to visualize the spreading of the virus
            across Italian provinces. The code of the animation
            is available at 
            <a href="https://github.com/gianmarco-todesco/covid-19-it-viewer">https://github.com/gianmarco-todesco/covid-19-it-viewer</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Circles are centered on the provinces main towns. Their radius is proportional to the log of the total number of
            recorded cases (active and closed).
